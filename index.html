					<p class="intro">
						In an age of <em>information overload</em>, a room is comforting because it's <span class="underline">finite, often with a specific intended purpose</span>. Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion. You can also position elements in spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances to adjacent rooms through
						links. In the early days of <a href="#">The Creative Independent</a>, we sometimes thought of TCI's website like a house next to a river. We considered the interviews the flowing water, as they were our house's nutrients and source of life. We would collect and drink from the water every day. But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would change our house. We'd wake
						up to see a new door where a picture frame once was. Knowledge became the architect. Like any metaphor, it's not perfect. For better or worse, it's much more difficult to delete a building than a website.

						Zooming into this room inside this house, we see a shelf. Maybe a shelf is easier to think about than a whole room. What does one put on a shelf? Books and objects from life? Sure, go ahead. Thankfully there's nothing too heavy on the shelf, or else it would break. A few small things will do, knowledge-containing or not. Plus, lighter things are easy to change out. Is a book or trinket
						“so last year?” Move it off the shelf! Consider what surprising juxtapositions you can make on your little shelf.<sup>1</sup>

					<p>Plants can’t be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be the same way, as long as you pick the right soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day and let it gradually grow.</p>
					<p>Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year it’ll bear fruit, if you’re lucky. Fruit could be friends or admiration or money—success comes in many forms. But don’t get too excited or set goals: that’s not the idea here. Like I said, plants can’t be rushed.<sup>2</sup></p>

					<p>Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once they’re little seedlings and can stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.</p>
					<p>Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and that’s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both. Plants remind us that life is about balance.</p>
					<p>It’s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.</p>

				<h3 class="chapter-headline">Website as puddle</h3>
				<p>A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection of rainwater. They usually appear after rainstorms. Like a storm, creating a website can happen in a burst. Sometimes it’s nice to have a few bursts/storms of creating a website, since the zone can be so elusive.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Some people even call rain “computer weather.”</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>There is also no state of “completeness” to a website, like a puddle, since they’re ephemeral by nature. Sometimes they can be very big and reflective. Despite their temporal nature, I’ve even seen some creatures thrive in puddles. Meanwhile, some smaller puddles may only last a day.</p>
				<p>Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible reflective surface, needs to last long. If the world doesn’t end tomorrow, there will be another storm. And where there’s a hole, a puddle will appear again. Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.</p>

				<h3 class="chapter-headline">Website as thrown rock that’s now falling deep into the ocean</h3>

				<p>Sometimes you don’t want a website that you’ll have to maintain. You have other things to do.Why not consider your website a beautiful rock with a unique shape which you spent hours finding, only to throw it into the water until it hits the ocean floor? You will never know when it hits the floor, and you won’t care.</p>
				<p>Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over again, if you like. You can throw as many websites as you want into the ocean. When an idea comes, find a rock and throw it.</p>
